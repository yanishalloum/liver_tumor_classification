# Liver Tumor Classification


## About

This project aims at detecting tumors in liver scans using a deep learning model trained on a large dataset.


## Models with their Accuracy of Prediction

|          Model           | Accuracy |
| ------------------------ | -------- |
|    Simple CNN Model      |          |
|    Pretrained VGG16      |          |
|    Not pretrained VGG16  |          |
